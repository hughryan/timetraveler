The Time Traveler app is designed for travelers who need to cross time zones.
Time Traveler adjusts the users circadian rhythm to the new time zone by providing new wake and sleep times each day.

For the best results we recommend you do the following:

- Start the app on the first day you can change your current sleep schedule.

- Don't overshift your schedule to make up for lost time.
If you wake up or go to sleep at the wrong time don't try to make up for it by sleeping even less to make it up tomorrow.

- Take melatonin before you go to sleep if you're having trouble sleeping.

- If you're having trouble staying awake caffine is an option.
